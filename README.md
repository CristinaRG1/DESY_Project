This file contains codes which calculates the electroweak diboson production cross section for WW, WZ and ZZ events. 
All measurements are made at a center of mass energy of sqrt(S) = 5.02 TeV. 

In case of the WZ diboson production, we take into account events with three leptons and one neutrino. For the W+W- diboson production, we consider events with two leptons and two neutrinos. Finally, for the ZZ production, we will consider two different possible events: one with two leptons and two neutrinos, and another with four leptons.
